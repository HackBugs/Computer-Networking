Common networking devices and their types used in large companies today:

| **Device Type**        | **Purpose**                                                                 | **Examples/Brands**             |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Router**             | Connects different networks (e.g., LAN to WAN) and manages internet access. | Cisco, Juniper, MikroTik, TP-Link |
| **Switch**             | Connects multiple devices in a LAN and manages data transfer between them.  | Cisco Catalyst, HP Aruba, Netgear |
| **Firewall**           | Protects the network by monitoring and controlling incoming/outgoing traffic. | Palo Alto, Fortinet, Check Point |
| **Access Points (AP)** | Provides wireless network connectivity in the LAN.                         | Ubiquiti, Cisco Meraki, TP-Link |
| **Load Balancer**      | Distributes traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource usage.    | F5 Networks, Citrix ADC, NGINX  |
| **Proxy Server**       | Acts as an intermediary for client requests to enhance security and caching. | Squid, HAProxy, Blue Coat       |
| **VPN Gateway**        | Enables secure remote access to the network via encrypted tunnels.         | OpenVPN, Cisco ASA, FortiGate   |
| **IDS/IPS**            | Detects (IDS) or prevents (IPS) malicious activities in the network.       | Snort, Suricata, Cisco Firepower |
| **WAN Optimizer**      | Enhances WAN performance for faster data transfer.                         | Riverbed, Silver Peak, Citrix SD-WAN |
| **Network Controller** | Centralizes management of software-defined networks (SDN).                | Cisco ACI, VMware NSX, Juniper Contrail |
| **Modem**              | Converts analog signals (ISP) into digital signals for internet access.    | Motorola, Netgear, ARRIS        |
| **VoIP Gateway**       | Converts telephony traffic to IP for communication over data networks.     | Grandstream, Avaya, Cisco VG    |
| **NAC (Network Access Control)** | Enforces security policies for devices connecting to the network.         | Cisco ISE, Aruba ClearPass      |
| **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** | Speeds up web content delivery by caching data at edge locations.          | Akamai, Cloudflare, Amazon CloudFront |
| **Data Center Switch** | High-capacity switches for connecting servers in data centers.             | Arista Networks, Juniper QFX, Cisco Nexus |
| **Wireless Controller** | Manages multiple access points in large wireless networks.                | Cisco Wireless Controller, Ruckus |
| **Edge Devices**       | Devices located at the network's edge, such as IoT gateways.               | Cisco IoT Gateway, Dell Edge Devices |
| **Media Converters**   | Converts different media types (e.g., fiber to Ethernet).                  | TP-Link, StarTech, TRENDnet     |

### **Key Points:**
- **Scalability:** Devices like high-end routers and switches are crucial for scaling networks in large organizations.
- **Security:** Firewalls, VPNs, IDS/IPS, and NAC solutions ensure network safety.
- **Performance:** Load balancers, WAN optimizers, and CDNs improve efficiency.
- **Wireless Connectivity:** Access points and wireless controllers are essential for seamless Wi-Fi coverage in offices. 

This table reflects the diverse set of devices commonly used in modern large-scale networks.
